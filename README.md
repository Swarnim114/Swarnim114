# Hi, I’m Swarnim

I am a third-year computer science student with a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms and hands-on experience building backend systems and full-stack applications. I am particularly interested in system design and understanding how applications are deployed and managed in real-world environments.

## About Me

I enjoy working on problems involving system design, backend engineering, and infrastructure. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and building applications that scale beyond local development. I prefer learning by building complete systems, from design to deployment.

## What I’m Working On
- System design and architecture
- Backend and API development
- DevOps workflows including CI/CD and container orchestration
- End-to-end project development and deployment

I am open to collaborations on backend, system design, and DevOps-oriented projects.
